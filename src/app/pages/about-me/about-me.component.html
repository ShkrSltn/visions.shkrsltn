        <h2>Hello, I'm Shakir</h2>
        <p>
          I'm not going to try to sound cool or better than I am. I'm
          <span class="highlight">24 years old</span>, born and raised in a
          small village in <span class="highlight">Ukraine</span>, I'm a
          <span class="highlight">Meskhetian Turk</span>, I've always been
          interested in <span class="highlight">computers</span>, especially how
          it all works, and I've always dreamed of getting that power when you
          using just a computer you can create so many things. In 2018 I entered
          the <span class="highlight">National Mechnikov University</span> in
          Odessa, after successful graduation in 2023 I came to
          <span class="highlight">Switzerland</span>, where I live now.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have a pretty good basic knowledge of almost everything in
          <span class="highlight">IT</span>, which is what I was taught at
          university. After arriving in Switzerland I had a chance to get to
          <span class="highlight">power.coders</span>, where I got a lot of
          information about Switzerland, about work culture, about
          opportunities, learnt new development skills, and one of the most
          important things I met a lot of very cool people.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've always loved to learn, loved to develop, yes, there were times
          when I 'fell out', didn't understand how to do it, who to turn to,
          etc. But one of my favourite skills is that I don't like to give up, I
          hate that feeling and I always want to win than lose.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now I work as an intern at
          <span class="highlight">BFH Fachhohschule</span> as a
          <span class="highlight">Full Stack developer</span>, where I got a
          chance to work on quite interesting projects, to get experience,
          develop and get new skills both social and hard. Since the first day
          of university I had a desire to work on projects that can be
          <span class="highlight">useful to people</span>, not only bring money
          to someone, but maybe also help someone, this thought always gave me
          some warmth inside, I always wanted to feel it. The thought that what
          you have created where on earth people use it and it helps them - what
          could be better?
        </p>
        <p>
          In a world where both completely
          <span class="highlight">dark</span> people and completely
          <span class="highlight">bright</span> people have a chance to live, I
          have always wanted and will always want to be on the side of the
          light.

        <h3>Movies and Series</h3>
        <p>
          I love to watch good films and TV series. It might seem trivial, but
          watching them also requires a certain skill — you need to be able to
          appreciate them, learn something new through them, and, most
          importantly, truly enjoy the experience.
        </p>

      <div class="interest-item">
        <h3>Psychology</h3>
        <p>
          I have kind of interest in psychology, especially today it's hard to
          understand people, so I try to learn more about it. More you
          understand, easier to behave in different situations.
        </p>

      <div class="interest-item">
        <h3>Traveling</h3>
        <p>
          New interest after I came Switzerland. It is super interesting to see
          different places, different cultures, different lifes.
